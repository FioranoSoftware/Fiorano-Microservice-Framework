Fiorano Microservice framework provides SDKs (presently in Java, C#, C and C++) to build microservices. The business logic can be plugged into the generated code. The microservices can then be build and deployed to Fiorano Microservice Platform using Maven.

The framework also provides samples which demonstrate general usage patterns. Some of the commonly used microservices int the enterpise version are also open for reference for developers looking to build their own services.
