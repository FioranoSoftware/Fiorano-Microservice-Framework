# Fiorano Microservice Framework

Fiorano Microservice framework provides SDKs (presently in Java, C#, C and C++) to build microservices. The business logic can be plugged into the generated code. The microservices can then be built and deployed to Fiorano Microservice Platform using Maven.

The framework also provides samples which demonstrate general usage patterns. Some of the commonly used microservices in the enterpise version are also open for reference for the developers who are looking to build their own services.
